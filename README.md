# User Story Generator

This script helps you create user stories. A user story is a short, informal explanation of a software feature. It describes the user who wants the feature, what they want, and why they want it.

## How to use

To use the script, simply run it from the command line.

```bash
./story.sh
```

The script will prompt you to answer three questions:

1. As a ... :
1. I want to ... :
1. So that ... :

The script will then calculate a score for your user story based on the length of your responses. The higher the score, the better the user story.

## Example

Here is an example of a user story that was generated by the script:

```
As a customer, I want to be able to collect coins so that I can feel a sense of accomplishment.
```

This user story received a score of `80`, which is considered to be a good score.

## Tips

Here are some tips for creating good user stories:

* Make sure your user stories are clear and concise.
* Use specific language to describe the user, the feature, and the outcome.
* Be as specific as possible when describing the outcome.
* The user story should be something that the user can relate to.
